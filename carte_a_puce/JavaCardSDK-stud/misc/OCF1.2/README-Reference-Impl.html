<a NAME="RefImpl"></a>Reference Implementation README</h1>
Since release 1.1 of the OpenCard Framework, the code making up the framework
is organized in components. Each component is made up of one or more Java
packages that provide a well-defined functionality to the application developer.
To aid downloading, the components have been grouped together into installation
packages.
<br>In the OCF1.2 release an additional installation package was added:
The BaseOCF package. This package contains the base-core and base-opt packages,
which contain the fundamental OCF classes and which are the base that is
needed in every OCF1.2 installation.
<p>The contents of the OCF Reference Implementation installation package
is described under <a href="README-Reference-Impl.html#Components">Components</a>.
To learn about the remaining installation packages, read <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>.
<p>Since it can be tedious to enter a large number of JAR files, each of
which having a long file name, into the classpath, a tool has been provided
that can repackage a selected set of JAR files into one target JAR file.
This tool is described in <a href="#rejar">Using the Rejar Tool</a>.

<h2>
<a NAME="Components"></a>Components</h2>
The reference implementation contains source code, API documentation, and
a JAR file for each component. The source code and API documentation is
located under the <b>components/&lt;component name> </b>directory, while
the JAR files are located in the <b>lib</b> subdirectory. The component
and corresponding JAR file names can be taken from the table below. Clicking
on the component name will take you to the API documentation.

<h2>
<a NAME="Installation"></a>OCF Installation Packages</h2>
The installation packages were defined to satisfy the U.S. restrictions
on export of cryptographic code as well to allow separation of proprietary
code from the publically available reference implementation.
<p>The installation packages build on one another to avoid duplicating
code.
<ol>
<li>
<a href="README-BaseOCF.html#_top_">BaseOCF</a> - contains the exportable
(according to export restrictions) source and executable code of the OpenCard
Framework owned by the OpenCard Framework consortium. This package is required
by all other packages.</li>

<li>
<a href="README-Reference-Impl.html#_top_">Reference Implementation</a>
- contains the exportable (according to export restrictions) source and
executable code. This package is required by all other packages.</li>

<li>
<a href="README-Reference-Impl-US.html#_top_">Reference Implementation
U.S. Extension</a> - contains reference implementation functionality that
cannot be exported outside North America.</li>

<a NAME="rejar"></a>Using the Rejar Tool</h2>

<h4>
Intention</h4>
Including several Jar archives into the CLASSPATH variable can quickly
become an error-prone and frustrating burden for the user. To ease this
situation we provide this tool which allows to generate one big Jar archive
from several smaller ones.
<br>The need for such a tool arose because JDK's <tt>jar</tt> tool currently
does not allow to modification of an existing Jar archive.
<h4>
Usage</h4>
To start the tool type the following on the commandline:
<pre><tt>&nbsp; > java com.ibm.tools.rejar.ReJar &lt;sourceJarArchiveDirectory> [&lt;destJarArchive>]</tt></pre>
(assuming your CLASSPATH variable contains the necessary classes) *. This
will cause a window to appear offering you all the Jar archives that were
found in <tt>&lt;sourceJarArchiveDirectory></tt>. From this list you may
select the ones you want to put into your destination Jar archive. Do this
by selecting the according archive with the mouse and pressing the <tt>select</tt>
button. Undoing a selection works the same way apart from that you'll have
to press the <tt>deselect</tt> button. You can determine the destination
Jar archive in one of two ways. Either type its file name on the command
line as the second argument or into the text field component of the ReJar
main window labelled <tt>new JAR file</tt>. To start the repackaging process
press the <tt>create JAR file</tt> button. To close the program press the
<tt>exit</tt>
button.
<br>* If you are on a Windows platform and used one of the provided self-extracting
archives you will find a <tt>ReJarTool.bat</tt> file in the deliverable's
top directory that will start the tool.
