   * Sends a command to the smartcard and satisfies required access conditions.
   * It is implementation dependent which access conditions are supported.
   * If this accessor is incapable to satisfy a required access condition,
   * an exception is thrown. The same happens if the data supplied to the
   * accessor is incomplete or wrong. For example, a cryptographic credential
   * could be missing, or a wrong password may have been entered.
   *
   * @param command     the command to send to the smartcard
   * @param access      the conditions that have to be satisfied in order
   *                    to execute the command. The type of these conditions
   *                    is implementation dependent. Typically, an instance
   *                    of this interface will only be able to deal with one

   *            the command

   * @exception CardServiceInabilityException
   *            if a required access condition is not supported. For example,
   *            exportable accessors may be unable to deal with cryptographic
   *            access conditions like secure messaging.
   * @exception CardServiceUnexpectedResponseException
   *            if a transparent smartcard access failed. For example,
   *            the accessor may have to get a random challenge from
   *            the smartcard. If the smartcard returns an error code,
   *            this exception would be thrown.
   * @exception CardServiceMissingCredentialsException
   *            if a credential that is required cannot be found. For
   *            example, the accessor may have to perform an external
   *            authentication with the smartcard, but there is no
   *            matching key for that purpose.
   * @exception CardServiceInvalidCredentialException
   *            if a credential is rejected by the smartcard. This may
   *            happen if wrong keys are stored in the accessor, or if
   *            a wrong password is entered by the user.
   * @exception CardTerminalException
   *            if the underlying card terminal encountered an error
   *            when communicating with the smartcard
