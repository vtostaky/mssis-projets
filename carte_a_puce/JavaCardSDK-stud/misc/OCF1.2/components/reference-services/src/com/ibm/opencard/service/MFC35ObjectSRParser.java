/**
 * A select response parser for generic select commands.
 * This parser decodes the access information contained in a typical
 * MFC select response to a file or directory. It also determines
 * whether the object is an elementary file or a directory. It does
 * not parse any additional file or directory information.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is rather a sample implementation of the interface
 * <tt>MFCSelectResponseParser</tt> than useful in itself. Typically,
 * the object info will be extended to include file or key information.
 * An appropriate select response parse will be required, which may
 * look very much like this one, or may even extend this one.
