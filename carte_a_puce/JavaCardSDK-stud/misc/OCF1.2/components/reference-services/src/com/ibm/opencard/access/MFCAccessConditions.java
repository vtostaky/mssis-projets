/**
 * Represents the access conditions for a command class.
 * Access conditions can require CHV, AUThentication, ENCryption or
 * PROtection, or combinations thereof. Additionally, a CHV number
 * and key number may be needed. Instances of this class are used by
 * a <tt>MFCCardAccessor</tt> to determine the actions required to
 * execute a command.
 * <br>
 * The access information for all command classes is coded in some
 * status bytes that are returned on object selection. These bytes get
 * parsed by a <tt>MFCAccessParser</tt> in order to create instances
 * of this class. The access conditions for all of the command classes
 * is composed by the class <tt>MFCAccessInformation</tt>.
 * <p>
 * This class supports MFC 4.1 cards and below. It may find some use
 * with MFC 4.2 cards and above, but that is not yet sure.
