/**
 * Represents access information to smartcard objects.
 * Typically, smartcards define several command classes, for
 * example READ and UPDATE. Objects on the smartcard, like
 * files, have access conditions for each command class. These
 * conditions must be satisfied before a command of that
 * class can be executed on the object.
 * <br>
 * This class is meant to represent the access conditions for
 * all command classes that are relevant for a smartcard object.
 * It is abstract since the number of command classes and the
 * representation of the access conditions are implementation
 * dependent.
