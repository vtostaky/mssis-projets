/**
 * A credential collection for MFC smartcards.
 * MFC smartcards identify a key that has to be used by a key domain,
 * which is specified by a path, and a key number. A credential is a
 * tuple of a key and the associated algorithm, which is DES, RSA or DSA for MFC
 * smartcards. This credential collection allows storing and retrieving
 * credentials using a path and an integer as arguments.
 * <br>
 * When retrieving a key, the path provided may be that of a subdirectory
 * within the key domain. In order to find the key, a backtracking algorithm
 * has to be used. This means, if the key is not found with the path given,
 * it is searched again with the path to the parent directory, and so on.
 * This is the same backtracking algorithm that is used by the MFC smartcards
 * within the file system for keys with identifiers 0 to 3.
