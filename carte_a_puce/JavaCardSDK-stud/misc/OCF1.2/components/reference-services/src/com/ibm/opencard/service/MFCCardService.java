/**
 * The base class for all MFC card services.
 * It provides channel allocation and key information handling,
 * both not directly related to but required by card services.
 * The only card service actually provided in this class is the
 * <tt>select</tt> command, which is protected and will be used
 * by derived services. The rest defines the infrastructure for
 * card services.
 *
 * <p>
 * The select command implemented by MFC smartcards is rather tricky.
 * The implementation of the select command in <tt>MFC35CardServiceImpl</tt>
 * makes some assumptions on the card layout. These are <i>common sense</i>
 * assumptions that should not affect existing or future layouts. They
 * are mentioned here anyway, to save the time of those people that like
 * to check the behaviour of programs under strange circumstances.
 * <br>
 * A file ID that has to be interpreted by the select command of an MFC
 * smartcard will be checked to be an EF or DF within the current DF, to
 * be the parent DF, or the current DF itself. The MFC card services
 * assume that the file ID of the parent DF, the current DF, and all EFs
 * and DFs within the current directory are distinct.
 * <br>
 * <A NAME="ref1">
 * For MFC smartcards that support selection by application names, it is
 * further assumed that application names and the location of the respective
 * files are defined only in the MF. Subapplications are not supported.
