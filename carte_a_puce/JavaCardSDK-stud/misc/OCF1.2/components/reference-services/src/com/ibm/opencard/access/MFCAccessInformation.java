/*
 * Maintains access conditions for the command classes of MFC smartcards.
 * Each command supported by a smartcard has a <i>command class</i> which
 * indicates the behavior of the command. Typical command classes are
 * <i>Read</i> for non-modifying access, and <i>Update</i> for modifying
 * access to a smartcard object. Smartcard objects, like files or keys,
 * define <i>access conditions</i> for each command class. These access
 * conditions have to be satisfied in order to execute a command of that
 * class that refers to the object. The access conditions for all command
 * classes are typically returned by the smartcard as the result of a
 * <i>SELECT</i> command.
 * <br>
 * The class <tt>MFCAccessConditions</tt> represents the access conditions
 * for a single command class. This class, <tt>MFCAccessInformation</tt>,
 * represents the full set of access conditions defined by a smartcard
 * object. The access conditions for each of the command classes can be
 * queried here.
 * <br>
 * For example, data may have to be read from a file. First, the file will
 * be selected, and an instance of <tt>MFCAccessInformation</tt> can be
 * created using the data returned by the smartcard. Then, the actual access
 * conditions for the command class <i>Read</i> are queried, and returned as
 * an instance of <tt>MFCAccessConditions</tt>. This instance can the be
 * queried to determine whether, for example, card holder verification (CHV)
 * is required to execute the read command.
