/**
 * A cache for information about objects located on a smartcard.
 * The information to be stored are instances of <tt>MFCCardObjectInfo</tt>
 * or derived classes. Examples for objects located on a smartcard are
 * files and keys. The information on those objects includes access
 * information.
 * <br>
 * To store and retrieve object information from this cache, a key has to
 * be used to specify the object to which information is related. For files,
 * this will be the file path. For keys, it may be the path to a file in
 * which the key is stored, or to a directory in which several files hold
 * the key information.
 * <br>
 * This cache uses a hashtable to maintain the association between keys
 * and information objects. The abstract methods defined in the base class
 * <tt>Dictionary</tt> are mapped to their implementation in the hashtable.
 * Use of these methods, especially to modify the contents of the cache, is
 * strongly <b>discouraged</b>.
 * <br>
 * Some additional methods are provided that restrict the type of the objects
 * stored in the cache from <tt>Object</tt> to <tt>MFCCardObjectInfo</tt>.
 * These methods are
 * <tt>cacheObjectInfo</tt> to store,
 * <tt>lookupObjectInfo</tt> to retrieve, and
 * <tt>removeObjectInfo</tt> to delete information in or from the cache.
