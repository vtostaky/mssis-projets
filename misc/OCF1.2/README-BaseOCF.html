<a NAME="RefImpl"></a>README for BaseOCF package</h1>
Since release 1.1 of the OpenCard Framework, the code making up the framework
is organized in components. Each component is made up of one or more Java
packages that provide a well-defined functionality to the application developer.
To aid downloading, the components have been grouped together into installation
packages.
<p>In the OCF1.2 release an additional installation package was added:
The BaseOCF package. This package contains the base-core and base-opt packages,
which contain the fundamental OCF classes and which are the base that is
needed in every OCF1.2 installation.
<br>The contents of the Base OCF installation package is described under
<a href="README-Reference-Impl.html#Components">Components</a>.
To learn about the remaining installation packages, read <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>.

<h2>
<a NAME="Components"></a>Components</h2>
The base OCF package contains source code, API documentation, and a JAR
file for each component. The source code and API documentation is located
under the <b>components/&lt;component name> </b>directory, while the JAR
files are located in the <b>lib</b> subdirectory. The component and corresponding
JAR file names can be taken from the table below. Clicking on the component
name will take you to the API documentation.

<h2>
<a NAME="Installation"></a>OCF Installation Packages</h2>
The installation packages were defined to satisfy the U.S. restrictions
on export of cryptographic code as well to allow separation of proprietary
code from the publically available reference implementation.
<p>The installation packages build on one another to avoid duplicating
code.
