/**
 * A credential store for MFC smartcards.
 * A credential is a combination of a cryptographic key and the algorithm
 * it is intended for, for example DES. In the following explanation, replace
 * <i>key</i> by <i>credential</i> to understand what is meant.
 * <br>
 * Key stores are used to hold an application's credentials, in form of
 * cryptographic keys, for a specific smartcard. The same application may
 * support different kinds of smartcards, which may require different keys
 * for different cryptographic algorithms. For every smartcard supported,
 * the application will initialize a card-specific key store appropriately,
 * and present them to the card service in a key bag. The service will then
 * pick the appropriate key store for the actual smartcard.
 * <br>
 * MFC smartcards support different, nested key domains. Within a domain,
 * a key is identified by a unique number. The MFC key store is intended
 * to hold the keys for exactly one key domain. It therefore provides methods
 * to store and retrieve keys using integer numbers as key identifier.
 * If an application needs to define keys for different key domains, for
 * example a global domain and an application domain, there has to be one
 * key store for each domain.
