/**
 * Interpreter for smartcard responses to select commands.
 * The select command can be used in different context, for example
 * to select a file on the card, or to select an application directory,
 * or to select a key directory, and so on.
 * <br>
 * Depending on the context, the smartcard's response to the command may
 * have to be interpreted in a different way, for example to create file
 * info which may include file size and type, application info which may
 * include the application name and version, key info which may include
 * the cryptographic algorithm to be used, and so on.
 * <br>
 * This interface can be implemented to define a parser for select responses.
 * The parser is expectend to return <tt>MFCCardObjectInfo</tt>, which holds
 * access information. Derived classes can be used to add the context specific
 * information supported by the respective parser.
