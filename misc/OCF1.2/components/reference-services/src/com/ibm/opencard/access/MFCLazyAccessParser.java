/**
 * Lazy evaluation interface for access information parsing.
 * Smartcard objects, like files or keys, typically define access conditions
 * for all command classes distinguished by the smartcard's operating system.
 * Most of this information is not required by an application, either because
 * there is no command of this class that can be executed on the object, or
 * because the application does not use any command of that class.
 * <br>
 * To avoid the overhead of creating instances of <tt>MFCAccessConditions</tt>
 * for all command classes, parsers may implement a lazy evaluation policy.
 * The instance of <tt>MFCAccessInformation</tt> will store the encoded access
 * information, and parse the access conditions for a command class on demand.
 * <br>
 * While <tt>MFCAccessParser</tt> defines a generic interface for access
 * parsers, this interface adds a method for lazy evaluation.
