/**
 * A select response parser for file select commands.
 * This parser decodes the information contained in a typical MFC
 * select response to a file or directory. Unlike the generic class
 * <tt>MFC35ObjectSRParser</tt>, it does not only decode the access
 * information, but also the file or directory specific information,
 * like file size or structure. It does not decode additional data
 * that is sent when selecting special files like EF_CHV1.
 * <br>
 * The name of this class, indicating MFC 3.5 support, may be a bit
 * misleading. This parser also recognizes files types that are not
 * supported by this CardOS version, like variable record files. The
 * corresponding codes had been reserved, so there is no compatibility
 * problem.
