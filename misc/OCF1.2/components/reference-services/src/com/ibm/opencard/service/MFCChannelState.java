/**
 * The smartcard's internal state, as seen through a logical channel.
 * Every smartcard maintains an internal state, consisting of at least
 * the selected directory and some permanent access conditions, namely
 * CHV and authentication. If a card provides several logical channels
 * for communication, only a part of this state is relevant for a service
 * that uses this channel.
 * <br>
 * This class represents the internal state, as it is seen through one
 * logical channel. If there are several channels, there could be another
 * class that represents the global part of the state, which would be
 * accessed from here. However, the current MFC cards do not support
 * logical channels, so there is no such class.
 * <br>
 * The state represented here consist of the selected directory and file,
 * the file cache, and information on the currently selected file. Access
 * conditions are not represented, since we do not want to re-program the
 * Card OS. Instead, commands are issued following an optimistic approach:
 * The card will tell us if the access conditions are not satisfied.
 * <br>
 * The file cache found here is a candidate for a global state if there
 * are logical channels. Obviously, the file cache does not represent
 * the full hierarchical directory structure found on the card, but only
 * the part of it that has been accessed by now.
