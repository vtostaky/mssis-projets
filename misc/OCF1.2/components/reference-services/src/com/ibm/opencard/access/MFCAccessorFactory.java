/**
 * A factory class for creating card accessors.
 * Here, the term factory refers to the design technique, not to
 * OCF card service factories.
 * The MFC card services use card accessors to satisfy access conditions.
 * MFC access conditions include simple ones like password protection (CHV)
 * as well as cryptographic ones. Since cryptography causes problems with
 * US export restrictions, accessors are created in their own factory. One
 * factory supports export free password protection, the other one supports
 * cryptographic accessors, too. The Java reflection functionality is used
 * to decide whether the export restricted accessor features are available.
