 * A re-usable command APDU for MFC smartcards.

 * the base class by attributes and methods to set and query this information.
 * <br>
 * In the JavaDoc comments below, <i>SM</i> is used as an abbreviation for
 * <i>Secure Messaging</i>. It refers to the cryptographic processing that
 * is required to satisfy access contions that involve PRO or ENC.
