Features

   The Gemplus Apduio CardTerminal is an implementation of an OCF
   CardTerminal to access the Java Card 2.1.2 Simulator distributed by
   Sun Microsystems in its Java Card 2.1.2 Development Kit
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Installation and User's Guide

For installing Apduio CardTerminal

   See the Download Page for instructions on how to download and install
   the Apduio CardTerminal component on your platform.
   
   
Additional Prerequisites

   In addition to the prerequisites listed for all OCF components (i.e.,
   JRE, Comm API, and OCF), there are some additional required software
   packages:

     * The Java Card 2.1.2 Simulator distributed by Sun Microsystems is
       of course mandatory in order to use this CardTerminal. Please
       download and install the complete Java Card 2.1.2 Development Kit.
       
   
For using Apduio CardTerminal

   This section shows how to run a simple test with this CardTerminal
   (Apduio).
   
    1. download and install the Java Card 2.1.2 Development Kit.
    2. execute the demo2 sample, and produce the "demoee" file, as
       described in the Chapter 3 of the Java Card 2.1.2 Development Kit
       Users Guide.
    3. download and install the distribution.
    4. configure your "opencard.properties" file in order to use the
       Gemplus Apduio factory (i.e., ApduioCardTerminalFactory) for the
       OpenCard.terminals property and the PassThruCardServiceFactory for
       OpenCard.services.
       Example: (warning: the lines are not cut!):

OpenCard.services = opencard.opt.util.
PassThruCardServiceFactory

OpenCard.terminals = com.gemplus.opencard.terminal.apduio.
ApduIOCardTerminalFactory|mySim|Socket|localhost:9025

       Note that "Socket" and the specification of port "9025" are
       mandatory. However, "localhost" can be replaced by any machine
       name that can be accessed by TCP/IP (and on which the simulator is
       running).
    5. test the component with the
       "com.gemplus.opencard.terminal.apduio.test.Test" program.
       Example:
         1. Type ('$' being a shell prompt):
     $ java com.gemplus.opencard.terminal.apduio.test.Test

         2. In another console, run the cref for demo3, as described in
            the Chapter 3 of the Java Card 2.1.2 Development Kit Users
            Guide.
            I.e., type ('$' being a shell prompt):
     $ cref -i demoee

         3. In the console running Test, you should see the following
            output:
     Card Inserted
     Balance = 0x0032
     Balance = 0x0022
         4. In the console running the cref, hit CTRL+C, then in the
            console running Test, you should see the following output:
     Card Removed

   Note that this code is currently in alpha version and so limited
   User's documentation is provided at this stage.
   
   Please See the Javadocs for more details on the package API.
   
   
Limitations

   There are no known limitations for this component.

Developer's Notes

Sample Code

   In order to have an example of how to use the ApduioCardTerminal to
   communicate with a JavaCard applet, see the code of the following
   class: com.gemplus.opencard.terminal.apduio.test.Test.
   
   
Complete Sources

   Sources of the current version (V 0.1) have been compiled into
   hypertext (HTML) versions in the
   "components/apduio-terminal-0.1/doc/sources/" subdirectory.
   
   Otherwise, for looking at the sources of previous versions:
    1. $ cd components/apduio-terminal-0.1/src/
    2. and use RCS's command co(1) to check out the files.
       
   If you intend to work with RCS in order to retrieve, install, and/or
   edit previous versions, see also the RCS change logs that are provided
   in Appendix.
   
   
Troubleshooting

   This section provides tricks that are nice to know when using the
   component. It should also be enhanced in the future with a FAQ of
   common encountered problems.

     * No known problems,... yet.

Appendix B. GLOSSARY

   This appendix is informative.
   
   
   APDU
   
   An APDU, Application Protocol Data Unit, is the basic command unit for
   a smart card. An APDU contains either a command message or a response
   message, sent from the card reader to the smart card or from the card
   to the reader.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   API
   
   An API, Application Programming Interface, is an abstract definition
   of a service that can be provided either by a server, a component, an
   object class, etc. In the Java world, an API can be a Java Interface
   or a set of interfaces and abstract or concrete classes. For servers
   or other computing languages, it can be a set or functions (such as
   the C-based PKCS#11 API) or a language independent API defined in an
   IDL, such as the OMG IDL.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   OCF, OpenCard Framework
   
   OCF, the OpenCard Framework, is a standardized, easy-to-use framework
   for implementing Smartcard-enabled solutions and Smartcard-based
   services. OpenCard Framework capitalizes on the broad, cross-platform
   benefits of Java, providing an open architecture and a set of common
   APIs (Application Program Interfaces) geared for this purpose. For
   more details about the basic architecture, concepts, and objectives of
   the OpenCard Framework, see the General Information Web Document and
   other documentation.
