   This page is intended for "OpenCard Framework" users and developers;
   it is dedicated to the Java packages that provide useful code for
   using the PC/SC Resource Manager, to access Smart Card Readers. It
   allows to acces potentially all Smart Card Readers that have a valid
   PC/SC driver for the given platform.
   
   E.g., concerning Gemplus readers, the following readers have PC/SC
   drivers: on Windows all PC-link readers: Serial (GemPC410), Parallel
   (GemPC-Touch 440), PCMCIA (GemPC400), USB (GemPC430), or contactless
   (GemEasy family), and on Linux and MacOS X: Serial (GemPC410), PCMCIA
   (GemPC400), USB (GemPC430).
   
   Among other things, this page describes how to download/install the
   CardTerminal and use it, and also what new features are available.
   
   These packages ("CardTerminal" in the OpenCard vocabulary) provides
   the OCF CardService or application developer with a high level API
   compliant with OpenCard 1.2 in order to communicate with the card
   using ISO protocols (i.e., using APDU data packets).
   
   This is a second version with enhancements for T=0 and many other new
   features (e.g., internalReset, PowerManagement), and it is provided
   AS-IS. See the Important Note section below.

Primary Web Location

   This component primary web location is the official OpenCard
   Consortium Download Page as it is included into the official OpenCard
   Framework distribution (see the following package: "OpenCard Framework
   Reference Implementaion V1.2").
   
   However, the version provided here includes additional features and
   bug fixes. It will be forwarded to the official OCF distribution
   maintener so that it can be available in the next major release of
   OCF.
   
   In the meanwhile, it can be downloaded from the Gemplus Developer's
   Web Site OpenCard Page (in the "Technologies" section)
   
   This web site is the developer's section of the general Gemplus web

   simple form requesting an email address and a password (similar to the
   Java developer's section).
   
   In the OpenCard Page, you will find links to the PC/SC Wrapper
   CardTerminal Download Page. In case you are reading the ASCII version

Features

   The PC/SC Wrapper CardTerminal provides to the client CardServices or
   applications, an OCF CardTerminal communication API in order to access
   to the card and reader through standardized protocols such as
   ISO7816-3 (i.e., T=0 or T=1 protocols).
   
   In addition to this fundamental functionality, Gemplus has made some
   changes that were needed in the PC/SC CardTerminal so that it could
   handle the long APDUs (i.e., of T=0 case 4). In addition to this new
   feature, we also have made some other improvements. The list of all
   new features is:

     * automatic handling of T=0 case 4 long APDUs (as recently specified
       by the OCF Technical Committee, see the RFP1 for more details),

     * implementation of the optional "PowerManagement" interface,

     * "internalReset" can now return the first or the second ATR of the
       card. The ATR that is returned depends on the Power status of the
       card: if the PC/SC card handle is available (i.e., the card is
       already powered on), it retrieves the second ATR, otherwise (i.e.,
       the card is powered off), it retrieves the first ATR.

     * the Factory support both the mode of accessing to all readers by
       default (which was the case in the previous version) and a more
       fine-grained mode in which we specify the readers and their mode
       of access. The mode of access, following the PC/SC specs can be
       SHARED or EXCLUSIVE.

     * addition of new exception messages,

     * addition of a public method "setISOTPDUMode" to select a method of
       APDU chaining that is full-ISO (i.e., when a card returns a
       0x9000, then the terminal sends a GetResponse to extract the "le"
       bytes requested inside the APDU command) or non-ISO but common
       (i.e., when a card returns a 0x9000 to inform a good transfer of
       the APDU command, then the terminal terminates the transaction and
       returns the "sw1" and "sw2" to the user).
       
   Missing features, for this first release (in the 2.x serie) are:

     * The newly developed version (from OCF 1.2) that allows to lock the
       entire reader (implementing a new feature of OCF1.2, see RFC 17
       for more details) is not yet available with the automatic handling
       of T=0 case 4 long APDUs feature.

Installation

For installing the PC/SC Wrapper CardTerminal

   See the Download Page for instructions on how to download and install
   the PC/SC Wrapper CardTerminal component on your platform.
   
For using the PC/SC Wrapper CardTerminal

   In order to use the PC/SC Wrapper CardTerminal, you must:

    1. Download and install it (see its Download Page), and

    2. configure your "opencard.properties" in order to use the
       Pcsc10CardTerminalFactory factory.

       Example 1: Using any reader declared for PC/SC (the list of
       available readers is automatically computed), type in your
       "opencard.properties" file (on one line):

OpenCard.terminals = com.ibm.opencard.terminal.pcsc10.Pcsc10CardTerminalFactory

       Example 2: Specify SHARED or EXCLUSIVE options and/or specify a
       specific reader, type instead (on one line):

OpenCard.terminals=com.ibm.opencard.terminal.pcsc10.Pcsc10CardTerminalFactory|my|GCR410|SHARED

Appendix B. GLOSSARY

   This appendix is informative.
   
   APDU
   
   An APDU, Application Protocol Data Unit, is the basic command unit for
   a smart card. An APDU contains either a command message or a response
   message, sent from the card reader to the smart card or from the card
   to the reader.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   API
   
   An API, Application Programming Interface, is an abstract definition
   of a service that can be provided either by a server, a component, an
   object class, etc. In the Java world, an API can be a Java Interface
   or a set of interfaces and abstract or concrete classes. For servers
   or other computing languages, it can be a set or functions (such as
   the C-based PKCS#11 API) or a language independent API defined in an
   IDL, such as the OMG IDL.

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   
   OCF, OpenCard Framework
   
   OCF, the OpenCard Framework, is a standardized, easy-to-use framework
   for implementing Smartcard-enabled solutions and Smartcard-based
   services. OpenCard Framework capitalizes on the broad, cross-platform
   benefits of Java, providing an open architecture and a set of common
   APIs (Application Program Interfaces) geared for this purpose. For
   more details about the basic architecture, concepts, and objectives of
   the OpenCard Framework, see the General Information Web Document and
   other documentation.
